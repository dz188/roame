Entering Your Data
• Estimated Upcoming Spend (required): enter the dollar amount you plan to spend.
• Spending Category (optional): select from available categories (e.g., travel, dining).
Note: Current card data does not include category‑specific multipliers; recommendations will be identical until those are added.

Providing Existing Card Dates (optional)
You may enter the application date for each card you already hold. This helps the optimizer apply issuer rules more accurately but is not mandatory.
